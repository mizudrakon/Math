### Lingebra   
 * this is supposed to be my implementation of linear algebra into C:  
 * lvector is going to be a vector that supports the right operations like dot product and element by element addition...
 * matrix should support all matrix operations that I will remember...
 * I want to use fractions to represent rational and irrational numbers rather than floats or doubles, since they have a great impact on precision... at the moment I do not see if any of this should fail, but it's a work in progress mostly aimed on learning than any specific practical use.
