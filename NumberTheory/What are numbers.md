We use numbers to count stuff. They are a highly abstract and general concept that can be well used in the real world. Every object we perceive can be counted and compared, even though it can be difficult. We can plainly see 3 apples are more than 2, although they can be of vary different quality and value to us, the basic cardinality of the two sets of apples remains undeniable. We would also agree that two piles of sand with 1001 and 1000 grains respectively really do have a different number of grains, but we as humans just don't see the difference or care for it... well, unless it contains gold or diamonds.
We mostly talk about sets and their cardinalities (number of elements), because our brains are well trained on putting the world around us into categories of similar objects with similar properties. There are as many possibilities to quantify as you can think of, otherwise we compare object properties like size, weight, etc. How many apples fit in the basket? How many apples, bananas, and melons fit in the same basket together? We usually do this by devising a measurement unit that fits into all concerned objects.
At some point we just stop talking about objects altogether and discuss properties of numbers (quantities) on their own.
We talk about relations
