All the domains are infinite, but there different *sizes* to infinity. The smallest one is the $|\mathbb{N}|$ and every domain we find a bijection to is saidbto be *countable*, that would be for example $\mathbb{Z}, \mathbb{Q}$, but not $\mathbb{R}$ 
We can prove that $|\mathbb{N}|\lt|\wp(\mathbb{N})|$: By *reductio ab absurdum* (by contradiction), we assume *f* is a surjection $f:\mathbb{N}\rightarrow\wp(\mathbb{N})$, so every set has a unique pre-image. This way we can assume there is a subset *D* containing elements *x* that map on sets that **DON't** contain them. Also *D* has a pre-image *d* such that $f(d)=D$. The conflict is that *D* both **has to** and **can't** contain *d* by definition, so the map *f* is impossible and there is no bijection.
Such a complicated proof is only really necessary for infinite sets, since with finite sized ones it's completely obvious...
