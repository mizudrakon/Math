# Math

A repository where I try to implement all sorts of stuff like mathematical expressions, matrices...

## Calculator

- another school task;  
- evaluates simple string expressions.  

## CppMath

- so far I've defined a class for rational numbers and exp_num = number with an exponent,  
- I wanted to make an expression type around them, but it's proving to be inpractical,
- so I'm rebooting expression as aimed only on integer types.  

## MisCpp

- some more C++ stuff...
