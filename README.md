# small_projects
Kind of a project incubator

## Aggregator
- made as a school homework;   
- there are things I wat to redo, mostly having to do with polymorphism (I didn't know how to make run-time polymorphism work the way I wanted to when I was making it);
- It's a bit like remaking a simpler SQL, so I'm not vary excited to push on.   

## Calculator 
- another school task;   
- evaluates simple string expressions.   

## CppMath   
- so far I've defined a class for rational numbers and exp_num = number with an exponent, 
- I wanted to make an expression type around them, but it's proving to be inpractical,
- so I'm rebooting expression as aimed only on integer types.   

## MisC   
- stuff specifically done in C;   
- so far only this large_calc project that stores large numbers in base 2 to z (as far as English alphabet allows).   

## MisCpp   
- some more C++ stuff...
